        <div>Div is a block element.</div>
        <p>Paragraph is also a block element. <br /> That means it fill out the whole page.</p>
        <b>Bold is an in-line element.</b>
        <i>Italic is also in-line. That means it's size is only as large as it's contents.</i>
        <b>
            <p>You can put a block element inside an in-line, or vice-versa.</p>

        <h1>Headers.</h1>
        <h2>Get.</h2>
        <h3>Smaller</h3>
        <h4>As the number.</h4>
        <h5>Gets smaller.</h5>

        <p>
            The br tag is self closing, meaning you can never put anything inside of it.<br />
            you can use the br tag to break one body of texts into multiple lines. <br />
            Typically you only want to do this inside one large tag, not to break up in-line elements.
